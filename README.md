# dsa_problems

This repo contains solutions to the standard coding problems from Hackerrank, Leetcode and eslewhere.
The solutions are my submissions which got accepted after passing all the testcases. Therefore, the algorithms might not be the most optimised one.
Please feel free to add in comments, if you have a better approach for the problems listed here.
